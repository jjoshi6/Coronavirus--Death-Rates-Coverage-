# Coronavirus--Death-Rates-Coverage-
Machine Learning and Data analysis approach to predict death rates and spread area by manipulating the most recent (March 11, 2020) coronavirus dataset and visualizing results using tableau and excel.
Using Data Visualization tools like tableau and Power BI study the spread of the virus.
Study various factors responsible for the spread of the disease.
Predict the number of cases possible in future and predict the recovery rate for the same using Machine Learning algorithms like linear regression or other algorithm that is still a work in progress.
